// 5. Do... while loop
////////////////////////

// Do while loops are very similar to while loops, but with a slight difference. The difference is that in a Do while loop the code is executed as least once (even if the condition at the end evaluates to false).
// in Do while loops, the variable also needs to be declared externally.

// let i = 9;

// do {
//     if (i % 2 !== 0) {
//         console.log('do while:', i) 
//     }
//     i++
// } while (i <= 5)  


// ps. Do while loops are not very used in the real world, most of the time you will be using a for loop or a while loop.
